* vpn-torrent

Sometimes, I need to download some resources via torrent, and I usually use VPN connection for this, but I don't want to connect directly VPN in the host system.

So this is the idea from that.

** Usage
**** If you like me, just for downloading via torrent

#+BEGIN_SRC
docker run -it --rm --cap-add=NET_ADMIN --device /dev/net/tun txgvnn/vpn-torrent -v ~/Downloads:/data rtorrent 'magnet:address' ...
#+END_SRC

Notes
#+BEGIN_SRC
-v ~/Downloads:/data - The /data is workdir, so files will be saved ~/Downloads
-e COUNTRY=US        - The selected country for VPN server (Default is automatic)

#+END_SRC

**** You need more than rtorrent

You should rewrite the Dockerfile or entrypoint.sh for your purpose

** Thanks for
  Adhityaa - Author of a [[https://github.com/adtac/autovpn][simple tool]] to automatically connect to VPN
